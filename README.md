# sleep-apnea-clustering

This repository aims to be a pipeline for processing the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS) dataset for cluster analysis. SHHS is available for download through the National Sleep Research Repository (NSRR). The R scripts and library functions here work with the CSV files downloaded from the NSRR listed in shhs-process.R. (Users will have to apply to download those files through the NSRR).

Currently, these scripts are intended to be run in a certain order. We are working on combining everything into one package, but to replicate the analysis done in my thesis, it is best to run the scripts.
